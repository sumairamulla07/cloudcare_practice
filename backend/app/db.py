"""
MongoDB connection layer.

PLACEHOLDER: this module works out of the box against a local MongoDB
(mongodb://localhost:27017) for development, or against a real Atlas
cluster once you set MONGODB_URI in .env (see .env.example).

None of the routers actually query Mongo yet — they return mock data so the
frontend has something to render today. Each router has a `# TODO: replace
with Mongo query` comment showing exactly where to swap it in. A `seed.py`
script is provided to load the same mock data into Mongo once you're ready.
